# twitter-scraper
This web scraper was created for the Bloom project during Elle Hacks 2021 in 36 hours. Bloom is a website that educates people on topics of climate change such as biodiversity, air pollution and water pollution.

The web scraper was used to check what questions people had about climate change and how many questions people had about this important topic during the given week. The data was then used for Bloom to further demonstrate the importance of climate change education.

This program automates a Twitter advanced search, allowing to search for an exact phrase and between given dates.
The scraped usernames and tweet text with matching keywords and dates are then written to a csv file. This was made using Python and Selenium webdriver.
